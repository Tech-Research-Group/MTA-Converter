###MTA CONVERTER:

To use the MTA Converter simply type which row in your spreadsheet you would like to convert to a
work package and select the spreadsheet file on your computer using the "Open File" button. Click
the "Convert" button to see your work package data in the text box below. You can then copy that 
data and paste it into OneNote. Currently, the program populates most of the fields in an initial 
setup box depending upon the amount of data stored in the specified row of the MTA file.

I recommend reordering the rows in your MTA spreadsheet to match the order of the fields in the
template provided in this folder. This will allow the program to populate the initial setup box
data in the correct sequence.
